## General info
In this project I predict user ratings through memory based filtering and matrix factorization. This repository contains a Jupyter notebook where you'll find all the relevant code as well as a 4 min. video presentation I put together that summarizes the steps and findings of this project. 

## Live demo
Access the video presentation here: https://github.com/LuaiGhazi/Content-Recommendation-System/blob/main/Presentation%20-%20Content%20Recommendation%20System.mp4

## Technologies
Project is created using:
* Python 
* MySQL 
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit Learn
* Surprise


## Getting Started
To clone or download this repository: 
> git clone https://github.com/luaighazi/Content-Recommendation-System.git


## Results
Based on the results of each model with regards to their accuracy and run-time, the SVD based model is the most viable option to build a complete recommendation system around. However, based on my initial goal of building a model on top of which I could create a fully functional recommendation system, my SVD model’s accuracy score wasn’t nearly high enough.
